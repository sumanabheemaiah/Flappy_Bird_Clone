# Flappy_Bird_Clone
This project is a Python-based Flappy Bird Clone developed using the Pygame library. It replicates the mechanics of the popular mobile game “Flappy Bird,” where a player controls a bird flying between pipes without hitting them. The objective is to survive as long as possible while scoring points for each set of pipes passe
